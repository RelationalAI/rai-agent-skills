Three public functions in `relationalai.semantics.inspect` replace ad-hoc access to underscored internals (`_name`, `_relationships`, `_identify_by`). They provide a stable, typed, JSON-safe view of a model at runtime. Available from `relationalai>=1.0.14`.

```python
from relationalai.semantics import inspect
```

**Reading `~relationship` entries.** `ConceptInfo.relationships` formats each as `~{short_name}: {reading_string}` — e.g., `~my_short_name: A links to B`. The prefix after `~` is the **`short_name`** (for query disambiguation), NOT the Python attribute name. The attribute name is whatever was assigned on the concept: `A.rel = model.Relationship(..., short_name="my_short_name")` → use `A.rel(B)` in queries, not `A.my_short_name(B)`.

## When to Use

**Prefer `inspect.*` over direct `model.concepts` / `.relationships` / `.tables` access** for:

- **Inspect-before-authoring** — Before adding a rule, derived property, or decision variable, check `inspect.schema()[concept]` to detect duplicates, confirm names, pick up the real type. Closes hallucinated-surface, wrong-type, and duplicate-authoring failure modes in a single call.
- **Post-action verification** — After scaffolding or modifying a model, dump `inspect.schema().to_dict()` to report *what actually registered* instead of *what you intended*.
- **Session-hygiene re-grounding** — See [Re-grounding after drift](#re-grounding-after-drift) below.
- **Prescriptive formulation** — When authoring `solve_for` / `satisfy` / `minimize` / `maximize` over an existing model, verify every referenced concept and property against `inspect.schema()` before handing the formulation to the solver.

### Re-grounding after drift

The agent's mental model of an RAI model drifts over long sessions. Re-ground with `inspect.schema()` when any of these signal applies:

- **After `/compact`** — compression is lossy by design; concepts and property types you had in working memory may not have survived.
- **After ~30+ turns** on the same model — incremental reads leave gaps; a single `inspect.schema()` is cheaper than re-reading the source files.
- **When resuming work on an existing model** — new session, previous conversation's context is gone.
- **Before authoring on a "familiar" concept** — "I remember `Customer` has a `tier` property" is exactly the kind of confident-but-wrong recall that causes silent failures. Check first.

This pattern is cross-cutting: it applies to rules-authoring, querying, prescriptive formulation, and any skill that builds on existing model surface. One call; trust the result over memory.

## `inspect.schema(model)`

Returns a `ModelSchema` — a frozen dataclass containing concepts, properties (including inherited, with cycle-safe traversal), relationships, tables, inline data sources, enums, and rules.

```python
schema = inspect.schema(model)

# Human-readable
print(schema)

# Dict-style lookup by concept name
customer_info = schema["Customer"]

# JSON-safe serialization
import json
json.dumps(schema.to_dict())
```

**Typical usage patterns:**

```python
# Does a property already exist before adding it?
if "tier" not in schema["Customer"].properties:
    # safe to add

# What's the real type of this column?
amount_type = schema["Order"].properties["amount"].type   # e.g. Integer, not Any

# What concepts are in the model? (exclude reasoner internals — see filtering section)
user_concepts = [c for c in schema.concepts if not c.name.startswith("_")]
```

**Targeted access for large models:** `schema["Person"]` returns just that concept. Use this when the full `to_dict()` would blow the context window.

## `inspect.fields(rel)`

Returns a tuple of `FieldRef` objects for a relationship or chain — directly usable in `select()`. Replaces manual field unpacking.

```python
# Canonical idiom — select every field of a relationship
model.select(*inspect.fields(Item.successors)).to_df()

# Equivalent to the manual form, but handles inheritance and alt readings correctly:
# model.select(Item.successors["s"], Item.successors["data"]).to_df()
```

**Behavior:**
- Excludes the owner field by default. Pass `include_owner=True` to include it.
- Handles inherited properties correctly — `inspect.fields(Adult.name)` works when `name` is declared on `Person`.
- Normalizes alt readings to the parent relationship so field ordering is consistent.
- For direct `Relationship` / `Reading` handles, the owner is inferred when unique.

## `inspect.to_concept(obj)`

Resolves any DSL Variable (Chain, Ref, Expression, FieldRef, etc.) to its underlying `Concept`. Useful for reusable helpers that accept any handle type.

```python
# Accepts any DSL handle — raises by default if resolution fails
concept = inspect.to_concept(handle)

# Defensive use — returns None instead of raising
concept = inspect.to_concept(handle, default=None)
```

**When to reach for this:** writing a helper that should work uniformly whether the caller passes `Customer`, `Customer.orders`, `Customer.orders.total`, or an expression. Without `to_concept`, such helpers usually either assume one shape (and break on others) or branch on `isinstance` chains (which miss subclasses).

## Data Sources: `model.data_items`

`model.tables` only includes explicitly declared `Table` objects. Inline data loaded via `model.data(pd.DataFrame(...))` is tracked separately in `model.data_items`.

```python
# Full list of data sources — BOTH tables and inline data
all_sources = list(model.tables) + list(model.data_items)
```

Skills or utilities that list "every data source feeding this model" must check both. `inspect.schema()` covers both in a single call.

## Filtering Library-Internal Concepts

Reasoners (prescriptive, graph, paths) register their own concepts on the shared model. These show up in `inspect.schema()` output and are usually noise for user-facing introspection.

**Filter pattern:**

```python
# Underscore-prefixed names are library-internal by convention
user_concepts = [c for c in schema.concepts if not c.name.startswith("_")]

# Or filter by known reasoner prefixes
RESERVED_PREFIXES = ("_point", "Problem", "_edge", "_path")
user_concepts = [
    c for c in schema.concepts
    if not any(c.name.startswith(p) for p in RESERVED_PREFIXES)
]
```

If the user asks "what's in my model?" and you dump everything without filtering, the output is confusing. Filter unless the user specifically asked for internals.

## When Not to Use

`inspect` calls cost turns and tokens. Skip them when:

- **Greenfield authoring** — the model is empty or near-empty; nothing to inspect.
- **Short single-shot tasks** — no session history to drift from; inspect just adds a turn.
- **Highly templated work** — when the task is "follow this template exactly", re-deriving its structure via inspect is wasted motion.

A useful heuristic: inspect *before* writing code that references existing model surface. Skip it for writing fresh concepts, simple one-shot queries, or template-driven work.
